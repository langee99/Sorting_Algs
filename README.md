# Sorting Algs

Simple library I wrote to implement some sorting algorithms while trying to learn crystal. Currently only supports bubble, selection, insertion and heap sorts.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  algs:
    github: langee99/Sorting_Algs
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "Sorting_Algs"
```

## Development

TODO:

- ~~Bubble Sort~~
- ~~Selection Sort~~
- ~~Insertion Sort~~
- ~~Heapsort Sort~~
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
